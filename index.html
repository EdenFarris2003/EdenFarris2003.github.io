                <h2>My Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>My mission is to be an honest, hard-working, helpful person in my life. By helping those around me, staying organized with my work, and bringing joy through music for others to hear. I will stay motivated to get the job done, work hard and efficiently to help others, and stand up for what is right when called to do so. I am going to be a good wife, mother, aunt, and grandma to my family. I will live my life in a Christ-centered way, while helping others learn about Him. My mission is to always stay true to what I believe in, to do what is right, and to always be honest about everything in every situation.</p>
