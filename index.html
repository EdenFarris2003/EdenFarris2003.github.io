                <p>Hello there, my name is Eden Farris and this is my profile website.<br> I am currently enrolled at
                    Ozarks Technical Community College as a student getting my Certificate of Achievement in
                    Administrative Assistant.<br> I have been on the Provosts List, maintained a high GPA, and continue
                    to work hard each day for all of my classes.</p>

                <p>My passion is music. Music has always been a big part of my life.<br> A phrase I love is "When words
                    FAIL, music SPEAKS."<br> I have been playing piano since I was a young girl, and I have been playing
                    guitar
                    for a little over a year now.</p>

                <h2>My Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>My mission is to be an honest, hard-working, helpful person in my life. By helping those around me,
                    staying organized with my work, and bringing joy through music for others to hear. I will stay
                    motivated to get the job done, work hard and efficiently to help others, and stand up for what is
                    right when called to do so. I am going to be a good wife, mother, aunt, and grandma to my family. I
                    will live my life in a Christ-centered way, while helping others learn about Him. My mission is to
                    always stay true to what I believe in, to do what is right, and to always be honest about everything
                    in every situation.</p>
